Windows 95 is shown running below, following a "Compact Installation" on a 68Mb hard disk.  Before the machine can
start, it must download the disk image, which may take a minute or two, depending on the speed of your
internet connection.  You can also run [Windows 95](../) without the PCjs Debugger.

More information about this Windows 95 demo is available in the [PCjs Blog](/blog/2015/09/21/).
